# Express API Template

## About

This repository replaces the [Express-API-Template-JavaScript](https://github.com/andresilva-cc/Express-API-Template-JavaScript) template.

This template is still being worked on, but the goal here is to improve code quality, project architecture, and replace JavaScript by TypeScript.

More will be added later to this README.

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` as `.env`
2. Replace the environment variables as necessary
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install`

## Execution

```bash
# run in development mode with hot reload
$ npm run dev

# build for production and run in production
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```
